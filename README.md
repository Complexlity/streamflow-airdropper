# üíª &nbsp; Streamflow Airdropper

The app create a permissionless airdrop on [Streamflow](https://app.streamflow.finance/). Users can view all airdrops, available airdrops for their connected wallet and claim tokens.
Streamflow ony supports Solana at the moment so the app is build on Solana Devnet Cluster.

## üíæ &nbsp; Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/download]
- Bun [https://bun.sh/install]

### Installation

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Complexlity/streamflow-airdropper.git
cd streamflow-airdropper
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
bun install //or npm install or pnpm install
```

- Update Env

```bash
echo 'VITE_PROXY_SERVER_URL=https://share-worm-84.deno.dev' > .env
```

- Start the app

```bash
bun run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000


## üìÅ &nbsp; Folder Structure

- `src`: All files needeed for the app to run
  - `components`: React components comprising of all views and components
    - `airdrop`: Airdrop related components
    - `ui`: standalone ui components mostly [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  - `config`: App configuration including constants, env
  - `hooks`: Custom hooks use through the app
    - `airdrop`: Hooks used to either query airdrop info or mutate them
    - `token`: Hooks used to get tokens information from the solana cluster
  - `pages`: Standalone pages. There's currently 3 pages and the 404 page
  - `services`: Functions used to call the APIs and retrieve or mutate data
    - `api`: Contains airdrop and token related functions
    - `blockchain`: Contains functions used to interact with the blockchain and streamflow sdk
  - `types`: Types use accross the app. Airdrop and Tokey types are mostly generate from the return values of the services
  - `utils`: Utility functions use across the app.


## üõ°Ô∏è &nbsp; Proxy Server Architecture
Due to how the streamflow api handles requests, their server rejects requests from other domains so we use a proxy server to call most of the api endponts. See [Airdrop Service](/src/services/api/airdropService.ts) and [Token Service](/src/services/api/tokenService.ts).

## Known Issues

- Inconsistent responses between apis. When actions are performed, it propagates slowly from the chain cluster to streamflow api and this takes some time to reflect on the app. So different enpoints can return different results.
This can be solved by querying the chain cluster directly using the [Sdk](https://github.com/streamflow-finance/js-sdk). Will be implemented in the coming commits.
